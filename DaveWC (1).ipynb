The nike integration with Paypal or 3rd parties is really clumsy and not user friendly. You should be able to call and change shipping address (like any other site) without having to re-do the order.

Then he hung up, and called me back to say in a sarcastic tone that he called back to give me a number I could call to have him reported since I said I will report him. That goes to show that he knows he’ll get away with it therefore, he was confident to “call me back”. I don’t know how Jumia will handle this but I couldn’t eat the food, for fear he had done something to it. He was fuming with rage on the phone and acted suspicious which scared me and I threw the food away after seeing the peeled off seal.
